Using the Customizr theme to create a Bootstrap / jQuery portoflio site. 

This is a work-in-progress and is in no way complete! BUT, checkout the development branch and read the Wiki.

Customizr seems the most versatile and has Bootstrap3 baked in. The Customizr theme can be found here: http://wordpress.org/themes/customizr

This repository has only the essential WordPress files. This assumes you already have a database and WordPress installed. You must first follow the instructions on: http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress
